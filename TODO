WHATEVER DONE BY 11
DERIC: Pegasos, SVM we've implemented
SAI: Kernelize KNN, Baselines 

Graphs We Need:

SVM: 2d plot of hyper parameters for both SVMs (C and stepsize), Pegasos (lambda value) DONE
KNN: Linear (k values) DONE, Gaussian

Best test error for each

Baselines fix, plots


Add in data to tables to presentation
Try different convergence criterias for SVM (still slow as fuck)
See if kernelized KNN can be optimized
Why does the kernelized SVM library do so much worse????
